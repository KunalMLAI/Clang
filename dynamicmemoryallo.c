//dynamic memory allocation - allocate memory in runtime.
//or way in which size of a data structure can be changed during runtime.
//memory assigned to a program in a typical architecture can be broken down into four segments:
//1- code
//2- static/global variables
//(i) data segment - for initialized storage.
//(ii) bss segment - for uninitialized storage.
//3- stack
//4- heap
//C program:Stack Overflow - Typical example includes recursion with wrong base condition.
